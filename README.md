🌐 Web Development Learning Journey

Welcome to my personal web development learning repository!
This space is dedicated to tracking my progress as I explore the fundamentals and practical skills of building for the web — from HTML and CSS to JavaScript and beyond.
Each folder and file reflects a hands-on exercise, mini-project, or concept I’ve studied, with the goal of reinforcing what I learn through real code. 
Whether it's styling a simple page, adding interactivity, or embedding external tools like Google Maps.
